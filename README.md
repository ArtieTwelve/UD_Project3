Project 3

Each branch, 1 - 5, represents one of the five tasks. The master branch has been merged with task 5 so they are
identical. 
Code for each task can be quickly located by search for special comments, marked with 4 digits. I.E., if searching
for the code in task 3, just search on "3333" and all locations where changes were made for that task will be found.
